        <h1>Stephen William Hawking</h1>
        <img src="Hawking.jpg" width="480" width="560">
        <p>Stephen William Hawking was an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, 
            and author who was director of research at the Centre for Theoretical 
            Cosmology at the University of Cambridge at the time of his death.</p>
        <p>Hawking's scientific works included a collaboration with Roger Penrose 
            on gravitational singularity theorems in the framework of general 
            relativity and the theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation, 
            often called Hawking radiation. Hawking was the first to set out a theory 
            of cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and 
            quantum mechanics. He was a vigorous supporter of the many-worlds interpretation 
            of quantum mechanics.</p>
        <p>In 1963, Hawking was diagnosed with an early-onset slow-progressing form of 
            motor neurone disease (also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or Lou 
            Gehrig's disease) that gradually paralysed him over the decades. After the loss 
            of his speech, he was able to communicate through a speech-generating device – 
            initially through use of a handheld switch, and eventually by using a single cheek 
            muscle. He died on 14 March 2018 at the age of 76, after living with the disease for 
            more than 50 years.</p>
